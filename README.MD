# Open Source Software Guidelines

### Description / Rationale
This project is meant to both help onboard new developers into how we do open source, as well as help us maintain a shared standard amongst existing contributors.

It's motivated by the same reasons we believe in open source:
* Improving code & project
* Recruiting
* Good karma
* Street cred
* Getting in contact with local devs
* It matches the [10 principles](http://www.wired.com/2013/04/new-hackers-taylor/)

### Usage
Inside the `docs` directory, you can find templates for useful files that you will be required to include in your project (In this form, or your own).
You could also find a PDF presentation, which we used to introduce Open Source into the IT team, that you can download.

### How to contribute
We really want to get as many talented people working on this as possible. We must have a clear method to prevent us from stepping on each other's toes. Please refer to our [contributor's guide](/docs/CONTRIBUTION.MD).

### License
[Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) (TBD?)

### Anything else
Please join our discussion on [Slack](#) with any further questions.
